# Donna Beep

Back around 2013 or so, I worked at a startup called [Incredible Labs][IL] that made
a virtual personal assistant project called "Donna". At some point, we decided
we wanted our own notification sound. I decided that it might be fun to throw
together a little Python script that used some simple sound synthesis
techniques to put together some options. This is the result of that tiny side
project.

I always meant to do more with this, and even considered writing a set of
posts--or even a book--on how I approached this. That never happened, and in
the meantime, I think some others have done similar projects, likely better
than I would have!

So at the very least, I thought it would be fun to share this script as a
little piece of my own history.

The second output, "beepb", was the sound we eventually chose as the official
Donna [notification beep](/donnabeep.mp3?raw=true).
